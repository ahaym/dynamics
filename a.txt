Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:

In the dependencies for Chart-1.9:
    lens-4.17 from stack configuration does not match >=3.9 && <4.17  (latest matching version is 4.16.1)
needed due to dynamics-0.1.0.0 -> Chart-1.9

In the dependencies for Chart-cairo-1.9:
    cairo must match >=0.9.11, but the stack configuration has no specified version  (latest matching
          version is 0.13.5.0)
    lens-4.17 from stack configuration does not match >=3.9 && <4.17  (latest matching version is 4.16.1)
needed due to dynamics-0.1.0.0 -> Chart-cairo-1.9

Some different approaches to resolving this:

  * Consider trying 'stack solver', which uses the cabal-install solver to attempt to find some working
    build configuration. This can be convenient when dealing with many complicated constraint errors, but
    results may be unpredictable.

  * Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps in /home/mark/dynamics/stack.yaml:

cairo-0.13.5.0@sha256:1d00ce1828b6725579cbbb0ce3c3e960d54d9413f5bc29e748b3c93245c25380
lens-4.16.1@sha256:310f1b3bc2c064267637d1cc33074b557b107e8ea3e3f0617e44ad5a241d0886
